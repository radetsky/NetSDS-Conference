The "konference" extension can be used to access the speaker scoreboard from
PHP. The extension defines a boolean function "is_speaking" that takes a
speaker's scoreboard identifier and returns "true" if the conference member is
speaking. The speaker's scoreboard identifier is sent to the application
manager when a member joins a conference via the conference join event.

To compile the extension "cd" to the directory containing the php extension and ...

1. phpize
2. aclocal
3. autoreconf -fvi
4. ./configure
5. make
6. make install

After the module is installed configure your PHP server with the extension and
access the speaker state with the "is_speaking" function.
